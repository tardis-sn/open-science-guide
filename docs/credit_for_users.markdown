Recommendation: Add Contributor Role Taxonomy

# If you use the software directly with no help from the development team: 

![](https://shields.io/badge/-Requirement-red) Software is cited using the citation guidelines outlined on the website/readme. 

![](https://shields.io/badge/-Requirement-red)  If citation guidelines do not exist/can not be found contact author via email or open issue on tracker. 

![](https://shields.io/badge/-Requirement-red) If they do not reply to this - cite the website.

![](https://shields.io/badge/-Requirement-red) Cite software in text where it is used if possible. 

![](https://shields.io/badge/-Recommendation-green) Specify the version that you use. This is how you normally get the version:

![](https://shields.io/badge/-Recommendation-green) Consider submitting your paper to the gallery on the website

![](https://shields.io/badge/-Recommendation-green) Consider submitting your models/scripts to the repo.

![](https://shields.io/badge/-Recommendation-green) If the software is foundational to your paper consider adding developers as co-authors?


# If you use the software directly with help from one or more of the development team

All of Section 1 applies and these additional rules

What is enough help to warrant co-authorship

Developer merges your PR - no co-authorship required
You raise bug - bug is fixed by developer - recommend co-authorship

New custom feature that is requested by you is added to the code - co-authorship required
If you request a tutorial being added for your specific use case and it is added - recommend co-authorship,

# If you use software indirectly without help from the developers

Requirement - Follow direct use package citation guidelines. 

Recommendation - Tell the developers if they do not include this. 

# Generic use of the Scientific Stack
These are packages that you MIGHT be using and references to their citation guidelines

Pandas
Numpy
Scipy
Astropy
Jupyter
Notebook
Mathematica
R

Where should these citations go. Ideally in an acknowledgement section as part of software.
